- npm i bcrypt connect-mongo cors express express-session mongoose

1. User Model (models/User.js)

- Defines User schema with fields like name, email, password, and userType (for role-based access control).

2. Middleware for Authorization
   🔹 checkLoginSession.js

- Ensures a user is logged in before accessing protected routes.
- Checks if req.session.userId exists (for session-based authentication).
  🔹 checkAuthorization.js
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Reads the user ID from headers (req.headers.id).
- Fetches user from MongoDB and verifies if their role matches the required roles.

3. Routes (routes/user.js)

- POST /register → Creates a new user (hashes password using bcrypt).
- POST /login → Authenticates user (validates credentials using bcrypt.compare), stores session.
- GET /route1 → Protected route, requires checkAuthorization(["user"]).
- GET /admin-route → Protected route, requires checkAuthorization(["admin"]).
- GET /multi-role-route → Protected route, requires checkAuthorization(["admin", "sub-admin"]).
- POST /logout → Destroys session and clears session cookie.

4. Express Server (app.js)

- Sets up Express, CORS, Session Handling.
- Imports middleware and routes.
- Starts the server (nodemon app.js for live reloading).

5. Full Authorization Flow
   1️⃣ User registers (/register) → Password is hashed, stored in MongoDB.
   2️⃣ User logs in (/login) → Password is verified, session is created.
   3️⃣ User accesses protected route (/route1) →
   ✅ If session exists, checkAuthorization() verifies role-based access.
   ❌ If session is missing, access is denied.
   4️⃣ User logs out (/logout) → Session is destroyed.

✨ Summary

- Session-based authentication using express-session and connect-mongo.
- Role-based authorization using checkAuthorization.js.
- Secure password handling with bcrypt.
- Custom response structure (customResponse.js) for consistent API responses.
